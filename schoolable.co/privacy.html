            <p class="text-primary-light lh-loose">
                We use Flutterwave Inc for processing payments. We/Flutterwave do not store your card data on their
                servers. The data is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when
                processing payment. Your payment transaction data is only used as long as is necessary to complete your
                payment transaction. After that is complete, your payment transaction information is not saved.
                Flutterwave’s payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security
                Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
                Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our Apps
                and its service providers. For more insight, you may also want to read terms and conditions of
